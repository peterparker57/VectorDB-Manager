## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- OS: Windows 10 (64-bit) or Windows 11
- Processor: Intel Core i5 (8th gen) or equivalent
- RAM: 8GB
- Storage: 1GB available space
- PowerShell 7+
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)

### Recommended Requirements
- Processor: Intel Core i7/AMD Ryzen 7 or better
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 2GB+ available space (SSD recommended)
- Display: 1920x1080 or higher resolution

## Installation

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone [repository-url]
cd VectorDB-Manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```powershell
npm install
```

3. Rebuild native modules for Electron:
```powershell
npm install --save-dev @electron/rebuild
npx electron-rebuild
```

4. Start the development server:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Production Installation

1. Download the latest release installer
2. Run the installer with administrator privileges
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Launch the application from the Start menu

## Building

To create a production build:

```powershell
# Build using PowerShell script (recommended)
./build.ps1

# Or use npm scripts individually
npm run build      # Build TypeScript/Webpack
npm run pack       # Create unpacked version
npm run dist       # Create installer
```

The built application will be available in the `release` directory.

## Architecture

The application uses a self-contained architecture with:

- SQLite for document and metadata storage
- HNSW for vector similarity search
- Electron for cross-platform desktop support
- React for the user interface
- MCP integration for vector operations
- Batch processing system for large imports

### Vector Search

- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (via Xenova Transformers)
- Vector Dimension: 384
- Similarity Metric: Cosine similarity
- Implementation: Local processing using @xenova/transformers
- No API keys or external services required

### Storage

- Documents and metadata stored in SQLite
- Vector indices using HNSW
- All processing performed locally

## Performance Considerations

- Memory Usage:
  - Batch size affects memory consumption
  - Vector index is memory-mapped
  - Configurable cache sizes
- CPU Usage:
  - Vector operations are CPU-intensive
  - Parallel processing for imports
  - Background processing for large operations
- Disk I/O:
  - SSD recommended for better performance
  - Configurable write buffer sizes
  - Automatic index optimization

## Security Features

- Local-only processing
- No external API dependencies
- File integrity verification
- Secure storage of settings
- Input sanitization
- Error handling and logging
- Access control for file operations

## Backup and Recovery

### Automatic Backups
- Vector index backups
- Database backups
- Settings backups
- Configurable backup frequency

### Recovery Options
- Automatic recovery from corrupted indices
- Database restoration
- Settings recovery
- Import session recovery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Application fails to start:
   - Verify Node.js version (18+ required)
   - Check PowerShell version (7+ required)
   - Rebuild native modules if needed

2. Import errors:
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check disk space
   - Ensure file format is supported
   - Review import settings

3. Search not working:
   - Verify vector store initialization
   - Check database connection
   - Review search filters
   - Clear search cache if needed

4. Performance issues:
   - Adjust batch sizes
   - Configure cache settings
   - Check system resources
   - Optimize vector index

### Error Logging

Logs are stored in:
`%APPDATA%/vectordb-manager/logs`

## Configuration

Import settings can be configured through the UI:

- Chunk size
- Overlap size
- Parsing strategy
- File types
- Batch processing settings:
  - Batch size
  - Retry attempts
  - Timeout settings
